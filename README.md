caredroid-interface_wip
===============

On branch carelink-android-prototype_wip the app is working to comply with the diagram below.

This demonstrates that jockeyJS and the code within, can control the CareLink dongle through the android Host API. We will be working on adapting the javascript interface - using jockeyJS - so existing code, provided by @bewest, can interface with the CareLink stick using the implemented android usb library.

Take note of index.html and WebViewHandler.java, as those are the files we will be focusing on.
